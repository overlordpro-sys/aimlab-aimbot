Using object detection to hit targets in AimLab

During last month setup and trained meh model for targets with a pretrained coco model, low accuracy
5.7.22 wrote python file to autoannotate images using the already trained model. Now do not have to hand annotate for more training data. Started training a new model with only config, no pretrained model. Will see how it will go. Will use to resume from checkpoint after training finishes.
